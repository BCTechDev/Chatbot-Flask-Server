This is the official repository for the Boss.AI Flask Server, designed specifically for full flexibility. This is only one part of Boss, as this and the web client will be merged into one. This is so that Boss can run offline. 
This repo will be updated later on with the Boss datasets upon release. You can replace the datasets by using Boss Configuration Tools and retraining Boss to work with custom models and commands. 
Please note this is not a release of Boss in full, that will be in BCTechDev/Boss. This repo is used for demonstrational purposes only!
